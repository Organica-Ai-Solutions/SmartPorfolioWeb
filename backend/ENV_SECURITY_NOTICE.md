# ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE: Protect Your API Keys and Credentials ⚠️

It appears that your `.env` file in the root directory contains **sensitive credentials and API keys** that are exposed in plain text. 

## Security Issue Detected

Your current `.env` file contains visible API keys including:
- Polygon.io API key
- Alpaca API keys
- Encryption keys and other sensitive information

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediately invalidate and regenerate** any exposed API keys
2. **Do not commit `.env` files** to your repository
3. **Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file**
4. **Use environment variables** in Render.com instead of committing keys

## How to Properly Configure Environment Variables

1. Delete the current `.env` file with exposed credentials
2. Use the `.env.example` file as a template
3. Set your environment variables in Render.com dashboard
4. Never commit actual API keys to your repository

## For Local Development

Create a new `.env` file with your regenerated keys, but **do not commit it**.

```
# Use this format for local development only
# Copy content from .env.example and fill in with your secure keys
```

Remember: API keys are like passwords - they should never be committed to your code repository!
